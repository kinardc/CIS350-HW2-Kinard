## Technical Background
### Game Store Rental System
Edited a detailed front-end GUI for a game store rental system in
Java for my Computer Science II course. Users are provided with due dates, actual return dates,
estimated prices, and information on a given game/console that is being rented. Users are also
provided with various screens that organize and limit displayed rentals by date.

### Digital Stopwatch
Edited the back-end for a digital stopwatch in Java for my
Computer Science II course. Users are provided with various controls over the current time being
displayed.

### COVID-19 Database
Wrote the back-end and a very basic front-end GUI for a database
of daily COVID-19 infection/death reports in Java for my Computer Science I course. This
database included various filters for reported statistics.
